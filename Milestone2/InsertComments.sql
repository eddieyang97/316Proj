Do the extra credit for each homework assignment because they aren''t terribly difficult and it''s definitely your best grade booster. You learn a lot about the back-end, but you need to be very passionate about databases not to be bored every lecture.

The project this year is to build a calendar, which isn''t very interesting. Groups are free to choose what languages, tools, and technologies they use to build the calendar. Code must be designed to be as extensible and flexible as possible because new requirements may be drastically different from previous requirements. About half of the class periods are ''discussion days'', during which we discuss various aspects of good design and coding practice. The other half are ''work days'', which means no official class meeting for that period and groups are free to meet on their own. Overall I feel it''s worth taking if you are considering a career in software simply because it gives you experience working on a relatively large project from scratch and you get to be involved in all aspects of the project (database, frontend, backend) and also learn different technologies.

Classes may or may not be useful to you, but I highly suggest it. Watch his video lectures because he covers a lot of material not in the textbook (pretty useless, in my honest opinion). He tests over application so don''t rely on rote memorization. He does not grade for accuracy on problem sets, but do them to the best of your ability! They are the most useful resource when studying for exams. The curve is pretty generous, and he offers grade insurance up to a C if you do all the problem sets and ''try'' on exams.

Fullenkamp only checks for completion, though, so no worries about doing everything completely accurately.

This class is cross-listed with many different departments, and you will see lots of people BS so much with no insights at all. And he''s the toughest grader I''ve ever seen at Duke. Even if you work super hard and go to the office hours, you will still end up with terrible grades or even withdraw for many. His grading is very arbitrary, and you won''t know what he wants out of your essays. If you don''t want this unpredictable challenge or even damage on your transcript, don''t take his class. If you really want to learn about the topic, take other classes in environmental sciences or stuff, NOT this one! ' );

INSERT INTO Comment VALUEs('751', 'This is an amazing class and prob the best class i''ve taken at duke. Prof Liz is absolutely brilliant. Everything she said in the class is so eloquent and profound, making me want to write down every word she said. She''s a philosopher by training, so she sometimes goes very deep, leaving the class perplexed. She gives you very high-level reading and helps the class to analyzed almost word by word. The class is like two essays, but I spent 30+ hrs on a 6-8 pg essay and prob a lot more on the final 10-12 pg essay. This class is the women''s studies gateway, laying out the theoretical foundation. I highly recommend everyone to take this class. ' );

Midterm is composed of several short essays. You can do well on the essays if you have done the reading and tried. Prof. Miller is very reasonable and a fair grader.

He is a PhD student at Duke, and I felt as if I was doing a majority of his research in this class. We did absolutely nothing related to what the course description said. He is a very dry lecturer and very unreasonable professor. For creative projects, he ends up expecting everyone to use the same fundamental tools and concepts (which is ridiculous). He is never clear about his expectations, and when he is, it''s 1) too late and 2) way too unreasonable (the number of pages or deadline). We were supposed to learn how to use different digital tools such as Photoshop, After Effects, Google Sketchup, etc. but we barely covered the basics for all and any of these tools. He prides himself on not giving perfect grades and will take off a ridiculous amount of points for something very miniscule. This was an awful class that I learned absolutely nothing in and wasted way too much time. I can honestly say that everyone in my seminar class *hated* it and wrote awful course reviews; some students even petitioned their grades. Do NOT take a class with this professor. ' );

These problem sets are graded based on accuracy, so it is important to do them neatly and precisely. Comments: The class satisfies both my math requirements for my Econ and CompSci majors, which is a major bonus. The tests are difficult, and Professor Hahn moves through the course material very quickly, which can make the class challenging. I would recommend going to her office hours, because she is a lot more helpful one-on-one. Her lectures can be very dull, but she is a very funny woman which makes class fun sometimes. ' );

Problem sets are time consuming, but they''re extremely helpful. GO TO CLASS. He tries to give his students as many resources as possible to make the material easier. I learned a lot in his class, but if you get behind, it''s very difficult to catch up. Read the book (very good resource and required) if you feel lost and go to office hours! He''s a very fair and reasonable professor; he''ll make alternate assignments to help boost your grades or will take into consideration your problem sets, class attendance, etc. That being said, the material is pretty abstract and can get complicated. Unless you have to take this class, I would suggest not doing so and taking an easier stat class. It is supposed to be very difficult and geared towards math majors.
