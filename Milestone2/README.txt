Once we create our database, we can load the create.sql and the other three data sql files to populate the database. 
for our dataset that we are currently polishing, you can find it(rating.xlsx) in the zip file.
For web design, we are using the beer databse provided in the course page as an example for our own web developement.

For "test-production.sql" it is integrated in our java code \play-courses\app\models\CourseDB.java. We also have sample.sql and sample.out in the zipfile in case you need more information.
For "DEMO" folder, it is our demo presentation of web design, you can start with home.html to run sample search and links.
For "Play course" folder, it is our web implementation using JAVA/PLAY.
