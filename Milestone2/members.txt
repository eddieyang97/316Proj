Eddie primarily worked on UI and demo presentation.
Frank Yin worked primarily on Java web implementation.
Frank Qu worked primarily on populating database and editing progress report.
Jack worked primarily on fixing database info and formatting data.

Everyone worked hard on the project, but there is still a long way to go.
